Things to take note (to avoid such same errors/mistakes):

CICD scripts seems to be copied over from workplace, there this "dso-approval" stage missing
Incomplete submission, missing terraform resources, architecture diagram as well as the CICD plan stated in the challenge
Infra IaC is incomplete, underlying resources such as the creation of VPC and subnet are missing
The code repo does not have a proper structure, infra and app are not separated into their respective folders
There is no architecture diagram and CICD diagram can be better improved to illustrate the flow of the pipeline
